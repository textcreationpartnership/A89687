            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169790:27"/>in this perillous time, it is indifferently well knowne, that many (albeit they boaſt them of God) do not yet know the mans treſpaſſing, and lying againſt the Lord, nor the fall or ſeparation from their God; and do nevertheleſſe ſpeak much of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and converting unto God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I alſo truly note, that in ſuch a ſtate (whileſt this is unknown to the man) neither the mans repentance for ſin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<note n="x" place="margin">Eſa. 55.</note> his converſion to God, neither his praying, is
<note n="y" place="margin">Iam. 4.</note> at all performed aright.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But this the man will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; but in the ſeparation from his God, he will judge of divine things, erect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and preach and teach the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſuch as in his ſeparation from God, he conceiveth for right, as if it were very righteouſneſſe: he will alſo faſt and pray, as though his matter (which he intendeth to himſelf) were upright before God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dear Father, dear Maſter, thou Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of our ſoules, vouchſafe to help us, and defend us, and ſo ſuppoſeth that God will not ſuffer him to come to ſhame.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But what availeth it? all ſuch ſhall find themſelves in darkneſſe, as the dead, and mourne like the doves, till that they perceive their tranſgreſſing, and their ſins
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169790:25"/>anſwer againſt themſelves, and ſo their treſpaſſing and lying againſt the Lord be made known unto them, and the off-fallen being from our God.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Then ſhall they ſay, and confeſſe, we have looked for equity, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe have preached &amp; taught, if happily it might any where break through or come forth:
<note n="z" place="margin">Eſa. 59.</note> howbeit, when we look about every way after it, it is no where to be found, and our righteouſneſſe vaniſheth in it ſelfe as a ſhadow, and conſumeth it ſelfe like ſmoke in the aire, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is farre from us; for we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before us but ſorrow and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Now whileſt that ſuch things floted unto me, before the eyes of my ſpirit, and that I ſaw the ſundry blindneſſes of men, whereunder they lay bound with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, through the falling away from their God, (which fall
<note n="a" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2</note> when I ſaw it was ſo deep, and ſo utterly unknowne, that the children of men were by meanes of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly incloſed and covered therein, with many grievous darkneſſes) I could not find that there were any of all the children of men, that were the upright people of the Lord, or ſuch as walked in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169790:26"/>the true light and upright love of Chriſt, or had continued in the truth of God.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Wherefore I found no confidence in my ſelfe, that any of all the children of men had been rightly turned unto God and his Chriſt, againe, or that Gods holy Miniſterie and Service of Love, through his true Chriſt (according to the promiſes) had had paſſage among any.</p>
               <p n="35">35. But rather I have found at this preſent time, among the children of men, ſundry kinds of boaſting, much brawling, contending, wrangling, and diſcord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Chriſt; which contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſcord came principally hereof, that every particular faction would in their blindneſſe, and off-fallen being or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Chriſt, and without the true light of the love of Jeſu Chriſt, be the people of God, and communalty of Chriſt, and make others contemptible and odious.</p>
               <p n="36">36. For when of the one ſide it was ſaid, we are the holy Church, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Chriſt,
<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 24. Mark. 13. Luk. 17.</note> it was anſwered on the other ſide, nay, we are it, and ye are Antichriſtians, a Congregation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and of the unbelief.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Againe, it was further ſaid by ſome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169790:28"/>others, behold, this is it which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, we have the right uſe of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, we are Gods people, the holy Iſrael, and have the true faith of Chriſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alſo it was ſaid again to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by others, nay, ye are heretikes, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and murtherers of ſoules: and thus every one ſtood for his Religion, out of contention againſt others, and not out of love to the unity of heart with each other.</p>
               <p n="38">38. In theſe ſundry ſorts of debate and diſcord, every particular faction was by their conſorts and adherents, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med holy, and all other to be erring, blind: the ones Teacher to be of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or out of the bottomleſſe pit, the others againe to be a ſpirit of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39. After ſuch a manner have I found many of them, and they were yet all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as themſelves ſaid: whereby there aroſe up
<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> great contention, hatred, and envy among many, and all about Chriſt, in ſuch ſort, that divers of them contended for that, which they themſelves knew not, even as the blind do, that ſtrive about the judging of a thing, whether it be white or blacke, whileſt yet themſelves
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169790:29"/>cannot diſcerne the colours of the ſame; but becauſe men ſay unto them, this is white, therefore they ſay ſo too, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at all any ſight of it.</p>
               <p n="40">40. In like ſort there were many alſo, unto whom men ſaid, there is a God,
<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> and a Chriſt, or they read themſelves ſo, and thereout aſſumed the ſaying unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and took it upon them, that they conceived and underſtood the ſame very rightly, and that ſo they knew God and Chriſt well. But ſeeing in the truth, they knew not that which they ſpake of God and Chriſt,
<note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> and that they had not the forme of God or Chriſt in them, and for that cauſe could not diſcerne the ſame; therefore doubtleſſe they contended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of like the blind.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Among which ſundry ſtrifes and diſſentions, ſome alſo laboured (by ſtrong perſecution) to reproach, revile, purſue, and root out or kill others that were not of one underſtanding with them, for the confeſſion of their God, and for their beliefs cauſe; which perſecution very many did ſuffer. Briefly, there hath been every where ſo ſore betraying among many,
<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> that they have delivered up to the perſecution and ſlaughter even one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:169790:27"/>
               <p n="42">42. But of all theſe ſundry factions, my conceiving was, that they which ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, and for conſcience, which they had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and his righteouſneſſe, were neereſt unto the truth; nevertheleſſe, the one condemned and blaſphemed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo well they that were perſecuted, as thoſe which were the perſecutors: and upon many came feare and anguiſh, with much perplexity and diſtreſſe of heart, and great ſorrow (for lack of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) over-whelmed many of the children of men, in ſuch ſort, that they came to great miſery.</p>
               <p n="43">43. There aroſe alſo many ſorts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries with ſeverall Lawes, Doctrines, Ordinances and Inſtitutions,
<note n="g" place="margin">Jer. 8. n. 25. Ezek. 13.</note> every of which would maintaine his owne to be Gods requiring and appointment,
<note n="h" place="margin">Supra. 1.</note> and the conſciences of men were (to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) drawn to the ſame, and bound therein, and every one loved and earneſtly affected his own.</p>
               <p n="44">44. I eſpied likewiſe many offences, and many abuſes, with ſundry erroneous miſunderſtandings, among the children of men, by means whereof I was often in heavineſſe, becauſe I was not joyned with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169790:28"/>men, in the upright forme of godly living, and becauſe they erred ſo ignorantly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And ſo in all this (becauſe many of them gave ſo high reſpect to their owne wiſdome) I tryed and examined their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and therein earneſtly noting and obſerving whereon the wiſdome of many men was grounded, I found and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they which were beſt ſpoken, and could over-bear or ſtop the mouth of others, with hidden reaſons or ſubtil argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and words of Scripture, thoſe were in their owne opinion, the ſtouteſt and valianteſt men.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Who ſo moreover, could in ſuch ſort (as it is ſaid) out-brave, catch, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap others, and knew how to propound and defend their owne ground in godlieſt and ampleſt manner, thoſe were eſteemed of their complices for the wiſeſt, and on them ſtood all their wiſdomes grounded.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Yet found I amongſt them all many well-willing hearts, that had a zeale to the good, but becauſe of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding which was found among many, and wherewith they were driven into much ignorance, and they perceiving the ſame, therefore (

               <p n="3">3. For I grew ſuſpicious, jealous, and diſtruſtfull of all fleſh, yea, of my ſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for in my humane diſpoſition after the fleſh, I found oft times no power at all, to enter into the

according to the truth; but were bewitched in their underſtanding and thoughts, bearing a zeal unto that which was not of God, and which did nothing further them to the righteouſneſſe: and therein was my humane underſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-times ſomewhat diſtreſſed, whileſt I ſought the righteouſneſſe among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, where it was not to be found.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But the Lord (out of his grace) hath ſhewed much mercy on me, and through his heavenly revelation, and manifeſting of his truth, hath inlightned my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and pulled my ſpirit unto him; his goodneſſe leads me, and his Spirit vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to ſtrengthen me in the Service of Love, that I may declare unto the man that which is moſt profitable for him to live in, to the eſtabliſhing of the Word, which God afore-times hath ſpoken out of his truth, and according as he hath promiſed

True it is, that my ſpirit is well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hereunto [even that the bewitching of many mens hearts might be done away, and the calling of the Gentiles rightly be diſcerned and underſtood, according to the truth] to the end all matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the righteouſneſſe, might out of love, be diſcerned and underſtood impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, (with an unbewitched ſpirit, and an unbound heart, according to the truth, but inaſmuch as I find little upright judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the children of men, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much more inclination

               <p>INaſmuch as I now have perceived the fall or eſtranging of men from this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome, and what a wicked nature, and crafty heart they have, or in what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bewitching they ſtand, that account themſelves for wiſe, and yet are ſtrangers to the godly wiſdome, which is according to the Love, and the requiring of her Service; therefore could I not give credit unto any of them as true wiſe ones, or upright Chriſtians, although they boaſted them of Gods wiſdome, or gave our themſelves for a Chriſtian Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>OYe children of the Family of the Love of Jeſu Chriſt, if ſo be ye love the Love, then conſider alſo the Loves nature; for the Love is clothed with righteouſneſſe, which alſo rejoyceth not
<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 13</note> in the iniquity, for her joy is in the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After ſuch a faſhion conſider ye the Love, and not after a vain courſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mind of the fleſh,

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169790:72"/>Spirit that cleaveth to the Love, doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wax old nor change, but it abideth for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereunto have regard, that your life may be in the preſervation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and fear not, like the fooles or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For why ſhould ye periſh with the fools and ignorant? wherefore ſhould ye inherit the curſing

               <p n="5">5. Separate
<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 6 Apoc. 18.</note> from them, and behold Gods right hand; for from thence cometh unto us the life of ſalvation, and the light of the holy underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Even there learne with the wiſe, the godly wiſdom, that according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ye may be not earthly,
<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 3.</note> but heavenly minded.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Suck alſo in like manner all gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe out of the breſts of the Love, and ſeek the peace of concord.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And when ye have gotten all this ſame, then play, ſing,
<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 96.87.</note> and praiſe the Lord as his little lambs, and
<note n="g" place="margin">Pſa. 79.95.100.</note> as the ſheep of his paſture, and as little children,
<note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> in whom there is no guilefull heart hidden, and ſo get you a naked lovely heart, ſuch as uncoveredly groweth up in the Love, and

               <p n="9">9. If now ye be hereunto well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then ſhall your portion be with the Kings and Prieſts, or with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the holy Underſtanding, and your fellowſhip with ſuch Senetors, as do further the Righteouſneſſe and your Service of the Word, with the peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, that do earneſty ſeek the unity in the Love.</p>

               <p n="11">11. Therefore be now (through the love and her ſervice) wholly

               <p n="12">12. Be altogether with one conſent min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereunto, and let the love have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence and dominion with you all, that the little ones may be protected, and the ſimple defended.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:169790:73"/>
               <p n="13">13. Therefore, O ye lovers of the truth, ſeek unity, and labour for it, and make a departure out of all heatheniſh being, which is after the courſe of the worlds fooliſhneſſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Do away the fore-skin
<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 10 Ier. 4</note> of your uncircumciſed hearts: lay away from you (according to the former converſation) the bewitching of the imagination, which glimmereth unto you before the eyes of your ſpirit, and glittereth before your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as if it were ſome excellent thing.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Renew your underſtanding in the Service of the holy and gracious Word, under the obedience of the Love, and ſo in the ſpirit of your mind betake you
<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 14</note> to the Love, and and as deer children be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereunto, whereby you may in the love obtain eyes of clearneſſe.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If notwithſtanding ye be

<note n="p" place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> blind, and
<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 5</note> poore of ſpirit, yet grieve not your ſelves for all that; for then ye draw neare to the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p n="17">17. If you deſire godly wiſdom, then
<note n="r" place="margin">Iam. 1</note> pray and believe, ſhe ſhall be given you, ſo far forth as your prayer
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> is ſtedfaſt, and as ye pray to God, in a lowly heart,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169790:73"/>with ſuch a proſtrated ſoule, as hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or pleaſure to do, and to fulfill the Lords will.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Men may find many which pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for wiſdom, and for the right ſight of his Kingdom; but they will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor
<note n="t" place="margin">Joh. 9. Apoc. 3.</note> underſtand, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, poor, and blind, therefore they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For although that the wiſdom ſtood even at their door, yet ſo well ſeen are they, and ſo rich of ſpirit, through their own wiſdome of the knowledge, that the upright wiſdom of God and the being of his Kingdome, muſt be faine to tarry without.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Therefore right well ſpeaketh the mouth of the Wiſdom, Bleſſed
<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> are the poor of ſpirit; for the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven belongeth unto them, or the wiſdome of God ariſeth (as light) upon them, and not upon the rich, or upon the great knowers.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For when we of our ſelves are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poor, blind, or unwiſe, or do forſake that which is ours, and do come to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meekneſſe of heart,
<note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 51. Eſa. 57.66</note> then will God dwell with us, and appeare in ſuch hearts, as alſo the Scripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169790:74"/>and then are we alſo poor; but God is become rich in us, by means of our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or becauſe we are poor in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: It is true.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Theſe and other like things have I in many places diſtinctly ſet forth in the <hi>Glaſs of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and do here alſo ſet forth the ſame in this <hi>Introduction to the holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> if any man regard it, let him conſider the inclination of mine underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But what ſhall I ſay? I find the man much too ſelf-wiſe
<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 1. 1 Cor. 1.</note> in his owne conceit, and too void of underſtanding, in the mind of the love; for commonly when the man heareth of the love, and of the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of wiſdom, he rejoyceth him in the hearing, and it ſeemeth as if it liked him well, likewiſe for a time he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But in concluſion there is nothing among the greateſt ſort but ſelf-feeking, and very little doe they underſtand the firſt Schoole-rule of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ſervice of love, for an entrance into the upright life in Jeſus Chriſt; but do underſtand every thing, which is held forth before them out of Gods wiſdome and love, according to their imagination, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169790:74"/>according to the mind of their liking. They ſeek thereout their own commodity,
<note n="z" place="margin">2 Phil. 2.</note> and not the Lords; they run clean back from the mind of the love, and uſe all ſubtilty to manitain their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Whereout I obſerve, that the man (which is thus minded) conceiveth of the wiſdom and of the love utterly amiſſe. For which cauſe I likewiſe fear, leaſt the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe</hi> (how plainly and rightly, evidently and clearly ſoever it is ſet forth) ſhall not of many be diſcerned aright, nor yet be conceived of, according to the truth.</p>
               <p n="26">26. If therefore they diſcern or conceive not aright of ſuch apparent ſentences (as are ſo clearly and plainly uttered) that even every one (which loveth lowlineſſe and righteouſneſſe) muſt needs approve the ſame, and acknowledge that the man and the world is created thereunto) how ſhould they then be able rightly to underſtand or judge of all the myſteries of the Kingdome of God?</p>
               <p n="27">27. For which cauſes ſake (to the intent no man might have occaſion to eſtrange him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the truth, unleſſe it might be by his own revolting heart) we have bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169790:75"/>or covertly ſet forth nothing, in the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. Notvvithſtanding, if any thing be covered or hidden unto any,
<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> it is hidden to the unbelievers, who have no deſire nor love to the truth, nor to the life which is of God, for ſuch are darkned
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, through pleaſure in their ovvn mind, and through the ignorance which is in them,
<note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> and through the blindneſſe of their hearts, do gather unto themſelves,
<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> a treaſure of vvickedneſſe, to an horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and ſo through their own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, do turn away and ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from the love, and from her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But unto all lovers of equity, which have a deſire and belief towards the love, [to the intent that by her ſervice, they might taſt of
<note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> the uncorrupted milk, the Word of God, that
<note n="f" place="margin">Eſa. 40. 2 Pet. 1.</note> liveth for ever] we have out of the inclination of love, ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and clearly, according to the life painted out, and ſet forth the <hi>Glaſſe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> that every one, who with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart hath regard thereunto, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the underſtand of Righteouſneſſe, ſhall be vvell ſatisfied therein.</p>
               <p n="30">30. If alſo any man turn his heart unto
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169790:75"/>God, and deſire to do his will, the ſame ſhall likewiſe well underſtand; that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the upright life in the love, (as it is ſet forth in the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>) is the upright ground of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that God from the beginning hath required of the man, which alſo in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring thereof ſhall continue for ever, to the Salvation of the vvorld, according to the promiſes, even as God hath ſpoken the ſame aforetimes, by the mouth of his holy Prophets, who have all
<note n="g" place="margin">Eſa. 2.60.61.62. Jer. 31. Joel. 2.3. Zach. 2.8. Mich. 4. Soph. 3. Mal. 4.</note> vvitneſſed and prophecied of that ſame upright life; for to come in the laſt time, and in the ſame ſhall alſo all conſciences be appeaſed.</p>
               <p n="31">31. For the end or fulneſſe of the ſame, is the revealing or coming of the Kingdom of God,
<note n="h" place="margin">Eſa. 35.51.60.65. Apo. 21.22.</note> and the beholding of the joyes and Salvation of the eternall, perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible being.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Oh that the man had any underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the godlineſſe, and did perceive vvhereunto God calleth him, and did in like manner prepare his heart after the meaning of the vvritten ſentences, and did let alone judging by the knowledge!</p>
               <p n="33">33. But no, the man is much too ſelf-wiſe by his knowledge, and therefore he is more inclined to judge of every thing after
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169790:76"/>his knowledge, then to prepare his heart to the good, under the obedience of the love.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Therefore it is very much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that many among the children of men, do oftentimes judge the ſentences and writings (which have out of the ſervice of love, their miniſtration to the good life) according to their Knowledge. For as ſoon as they read or hear the ſame, they ſuppoſe by and by that they have rightly apprehended, and well underſtood them, not firſt minding to enter in, to obtain, and to live in that which they bear witneſſe of, whereas yet the ſervice of our writing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hereunto, even that mens hearts (as is there ſet forth) ſhould be prepared to the ſame.</p>
               <p n="35">35. For men ſtrike up no alarm, in the hoſt, to the intent to make the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſty to the battell, nor yet that they ſhould but know the exerciſe of the warr, or judge of the Alarm-ſtroak, but that (with good courage) they ſhould prepare themſelves to the battell or fight. Thereby every one (that hath courage to fight) doth then make himſelf ready to incounter with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to root out his adverſary, or to ſubdue him.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:169790:76"/>
               <p n="36">36. But (alas) I find it with many, otherwiſe in that alarm by which the man is called to the ſpirituall
<note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> fight, to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing of his enemies, which (inwardly in him) are killers and murderers of his ſoul.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Therefore it is very true, that the children of this world are much
<note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> wiſer in their dealing, as concerning the fleſh, then the children of the Kingdom are, in that which concerneth the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="38">38. What availeth I pray you, an alarm made, if men prepare them not to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell? for many are perſwaded, that this is no time of fighting, and that there ſhall be no need thereof; ſuppoſing, becauſe of their unbelief, that nothing ſhall come of it; and lay their hands behind on the back, or put them up in the boſome. Their heads are giddy, as if their hearts were utterly unluſty, or diſmaid to the fight.</p>
               <p n="39">39. If one ſhould ſeek for men of warre, where I pray you, ſhould he find them? Are they not for the moſt part gone back,
<note n="l" place="margin">Levit. 26. Jer. 48.</note> and become faint hearted as women?</p>
               <p n="40">40. If they do but once ſuffer harm, and be wounded; or forced by any evill defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169790:77"/>or aſſault of the wicked) to ſuſtain any moleſtation or reproach, then are they perſvvaded, that the cauſe is altogether nought, and ſo running again after their caſe, they ſuffer themſelves to be ruled by women,
<note n="m" place="margin">Eſa. 3.</note> their enemy to raign over them; and in like manner make truth
<note n="n" place="margin">Eſa. 28.</note> with death, and a league with hell, retain peace with the ſin and accuſer, and become of one mind with the world, ſuppoſing that then all ſhall be well: moreover they make an appointment or concluſion with themſelves, that they will no more trouble themſelves with the doctrine of the Family of Love, nor yet vvith the battell, thinking, <hi>Let them run that will.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="21">21. Now if any man ſay, that he is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the life, and needeth no more, or that it is needfull no more for him to hearken after any other underſtanding, and therefore contemneth this form of the upright life, and his ſervice to the ſame life whereunto we bear witneſſe, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it, nor indeavoureth towards it, in the ſervice of the love, certainly he is yet in the death

               <p n="23">23. But if on the other ſide (O ye dearly beloved) any do accept this which we bear witneſſe of, for right and truth, let him not hardly over-haſtily perſwade himſelf, that he by his knowledge hath already gotten it; for there muſt at the firſt belief be joyned thereto, and then look whoſe belief through the increaſe of God bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſometh

               <p n="24">24. That truely is the right Croſſe of Chriſt,
<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 16. Luk. 14.</note> which we are daily with good wil, in the obedience of the requiring of the ſervice of love, to take up
<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 14.</note> in the belief, untill we be well exerciſed in the love, and in the holy underſtanding (whereunto we bear witneſſe) and not only in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

               <p n="26">26. Let every one take heed to his time, and
<note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> let no man deceive himſelf, with any vaine Opinion, that he do not erre.</p>
               <p n="27">27. For if any man

               <p n="28">28. And who ſo taketh not up his Croſſe, and followeth after the godlineſſe with his heart,

               <p n="30">30. Notwithſtanding, though men do now and then (through ſome imagination) think they have it, and have nevertheleſſe failed therein, yet are they not therefore to ſtep back, tarry behind, or to loſe the courage, but rather out of the inclination of love, to take good courage again, and to

               <p n="32">32. Though we find our ſelves ſometimes without underſtanding, how to enter into the life, or the

<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> in the belief, and not forſake the hope, for the hope
<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> leaveth none aſhamed, and ſo give our attention,

               <p n="33">33. Though at firſt he ſuſtaineth ſome damage, as to be ſometimes wounded, ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſhot, hurt to death, and by his enemies to be taken captive, yet taketh he ſtill a freſh courage, and abideth firm in hope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he be well exerciſed in the feat of war, who then is known for a man of war, that is one that underſtandeth and knoweth well, where any thing is to be won or loſt, and wherein damage or advantage lieth.</p>
               <p n="34">34. If therefore earthly warriours be ſo

               <p n="35">35. But a ſlothfull and unbelieving man that alwaies feareth, and is

               <p>O Thou man that doſt yet with thy will cleave to the obominations, and vain things of the evill world, wilt thou not once fear before the God of all Gods, before the King of all Kings, before the wiſdome of all wiſe-ones, before the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of all righteous ones, and before the higheſt judgement of all Judges?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wilt thou not indeed once remember that there is ſuch a God,

               <p n="6">6. Under which covering of the ſhow of holineſſe, and under the glorying
<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 24</note> of the Lords Name, the man boldly forceth on his arrogant conceiving, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his owne will, and forſaketh or rejecteth utterly the Law of the moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the Statutes and Ordinances of his people Iſrael, which God in times paſt gave them by <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſervant, and ratified by the mouth of his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For at the end, or
<note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 4</note> in the fulfilling of all the ſame, hath God brought forth his Son (the

               <p n="9">9. Therefore are alſo the Prophets which are thereout riſen up,
<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 24 2 Tim. 3, 4 2 Pet. 2</note> found falſe, and lying; and thereout likewiſe doth the Devill at the end of theſe ſame, bring forth the Image of his likeneſſe [namely, the ſon or

               <p n="10">10. That ſame is the adverſary of God and Chriſt, which is now revealed unto us as a child of damnation, who (for as much as the fall from <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come) hath ſet himſelfe

               <p n="11">11.

               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:169790:112"/>
               <p n="14">14. O ye deerly beloved, erre not ſo wholly with the erring blind world, nor with the conceitedneſſe of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-learned, that ye ſhould forſake the Law of the Lord: be not alſo
<note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 3 Rom. 12</note> too wiſe in your owne ſight, and judge not of all ſentences according to your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: for much ignorance hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the hearts of men captive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by oft times they judge ignorantly, becauſe by their wiſdome

               <p n="15">15. It is all reaſonably well knowne unto me with what a perverſe eye the man doth oft times out of the teſtimonie of the writings or ſentences which he heareth, draw a perverſe ſenſe, as it goeth now every where very brief amongſt men: of which ſentences (wherein there do many erre) there is both partly in theſe writings and likewiſe in the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> plain Declaration made, and how that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men do erre therein, becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But to the intent that no man through any wrong conceiving of the ſentences (which are now much treated of by the man) might receive anie hinderance to ſalvation, and that likewiſe every one
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169790:113"/>may be guided into the <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> of the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and to an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right conceiving of the ſame, we vvill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite certain ſentences here following, and uncover and clear the right underſtanding of the ſame, not only in this Introduction, but alſo in many places beſides of the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and ſhew the wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or ſight of them, and warn every one to beware of the judgement of his ſight, which he giveth by the ignorance of his imagination.</p>
               <p n="17">17. True it is, I have heretofore (in the beginning of my calling by God, to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his holy and gracious word; under the obedience of the love) ſet forth certain writings, but inaſmuch as ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences happily in them, were not uttered in the plaineſt manner, therefore have I with the
<note n="s" place="margin">Supra.</note> foreſaid principall Elders of the Family of Love, more amply and plainly expreſſed them.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Alſo in the beginning of my vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I could not find that among any of the children of men, there was any ſuch communalty of God or Chriſt, as was comprehended in the upright life of Chriſt (as is alſo before mentioned) but the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God, who is
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> ſpirit and life,
<note n="t" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.</note> and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169790:113"/>the eſſentiall love it ſelf, hath in my office or ſervice under the obedience of the love, manifeſted the ſame unto me, and ſo the true Communalty of God or Chriſt, which alſo is ſpirituall, lovely, and upright of life, hath he made known unto me in the ſpirit, I have alſo ſeen, heard, and touched, or felt it, and being of one ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, have my fellowſhip as one body
<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 12. 1 Cor. 12.</note> in Chriſt with the ſame.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Oh would to God that all men had the grace, to humble them under the love and her ſervite, that ſo then in the obeying of the ſervice of love, the ſame true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty of God or Chriſt, might alſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where appear and come unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; and that in the ſpirit of Jeſu Chriſt or of the love, to the intent that all errour, contention, and wrangling among them all might once have an end, and ſo we all one with another, might be of
<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 12.15. 1 Cor. 1. 2 Cor. 13. Phil. 1.</note> one mind in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But in aſmuch as I could not hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the beginning of my writing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or find among the children of men, that true and lovely Communalty which is comprehended in the upright life of Chriſt, and that all my deſire and love was bent to the upright life of the ſame Communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169790:114"/>therefore have I alſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my writing (out of the Service of Love) witneſſed of ſuch a life of upright righteouſneſſe, and of ſuch upright hearts, as the communalty of God or <hi>Christ</hi> hath her life in, according as the <hi>Glaſſe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> doth alſo mention, and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſame upright life of the true communalty of God or <hi>Chriſt:</hi> neither can I yet perceive nor know any other thing, then that the upright communalty of God or Chriſt (where ſhe in Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth or is revealed) liveth therein, and ſhall ſtill be minded ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And whoſoever alſo
<note n="x" place="margin">Sap. 8.</note> loveth the righteouſneſſe with whole heart, and hath a deſire to be joyned and incorporated to the only God and his true Chriſt, or to have his fellowſhip with them, ſuch a one will likewiſe (according to the ſight of the true life, which is appeared unto me out of the living God) be inclined or bent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch an upright being of the upright communalty of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (whereof we bear witneſſe) for to live, or to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein under the obedience of the love, through the belief.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Wherefore let every one note and marke our teſtimonies of truth according

               <p n="23">23. For ſure it is very lamentable, that the teſtimonies of truth (which are brought forth to the beſt) ſhould be taken over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwartly and not aright; becauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſight maketh many to judge perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and falſly, and unrightly to underſtand the director, cauſeth many greatly to ſtray. It is true.</p>
               <p n="24">24. It is recorded in the firſt book of the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe,</hi>

               <p>THere goeth alſo a ſentence abroad among many, (whereof likewiſe much mention is made in our writings) that according to the requiring of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, men ſhould ſtand

               <p n="2">2. O ye deerly beloved, erre not through any conceit of the imagination, but have regard to the Word concerning the upright impartialneſſe, and if ye mark the ſame well, you ſhall underſtand, that men are to be impartiall in the truth, and with thoſe that witneſſe the truth under the obedience of the Love, to the intent that no man take part with fleſh and blood, but with the truth, and be in the unity of the love,
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 12 15 1 Cor. 1 2 Cor. 13. Phil. 2</note> well minded to a like life of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169790:119"/>righteouſneſſe, namely, with all them that do under the obedience of the love, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and miniſter the gracious word of truth, and be comprehended in the upright brotherly love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But men may not thus be impartiall with the world, or with thoſe that with heart and will do cleave unto the world, that lie ſtill in the vanity and ſin, and that are not believing nor deſirous to obtaine any better thing: no, nor with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited wiſe, nor with the maintainers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious ceremonies,
<note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 12 Gal. 3 1 Tim. 6. 2 Pet. 2.</note> who are envyers, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, and evill ſpeakers againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word of Truth, and of the ſervice of his Love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Truly, with ſuch men are not to ſtand impartiall, but with ſpirit and life to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them utterly, and yet to ſhew forth the upright nature of the love unto them, if happily by ſome means they might be drawne (to their preſervation in the godlineſſe) unto the communion of the Love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But with the
<note n="d" place="margin">Infra. 18</note> lovers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe (as is aforeſaid) and likewiſe with the ſinners (ſuch as cleave not by their will to the unrighteouſneſſe, but do daily depart therefrom, and have a fervent deſire to the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169790:119"/>righteouſneſſe, under the obedience of the love) men are to ſtand impartiall, and to ſticke faſt unto that which is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that tendeth to the concord and peace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Therefore judge of the impartialneſſe with underſtanding, and put a difference between the godly life, and the life of the world, and try your ſelves, if ſo be you know your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Look into your hearts (obſerving whom you cleave unto, deſire, and love) how, or with what manner diſpoſition, ye ſtand impartiall, whether ye would rather ſuffer
<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> or indure diſgrace, reproach, and contmpt, with the Lovers of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, then cleave unto the honour, voluptuouſneſſe and riches, or eaſe of this world: Oh! I feare that many of them boaſt themſelves to ſtand impartiall with the truth, who notwithſtanding are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together partially minded againſt the truth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Nevertheleſſe, let no man take anie thing unto him out of any chooſing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be out of loathing or of liking, but let every one ſearch his own heart, how he findeth the ſame diſpoſed, &amp; examine once himſelf, whether he ſtand impartiall rightly or not.</p>

               <p n="9">9. And when the man hath ſeriouſly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and proved himſelf herein, in ſuch ſort that he knoweth aſſuredly how his heart ſtandeth, (in caſe he wholly love God and his righteouſneſſe, intend the truth in the Love with his whole ſoule, and deſire to deny and to forſake himſelfe,

<note n="h" place="margin">Col. 3.</note> love may obtain a dwelling place or forme in him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Lo, after this manner ought men to live impartially in the good,

               <p n="14">14. For ſome uſe ſuch ſentences for their own ſeekings cauſe, and ſo in ſuch a ſhow of vertue, their heart (in regard of being incorporated with God in the ſpirit) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth covered,
<note n="m" place="margin">Eſa. 29 Jer. 23</note> and eſtranged from God, and many alſo give great reſpect unto ſuch ſayings, inſomuch that by occaſion thereof, they do oft-times (according to mens private conceit) cleave to ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vertue, which ſurely is the very ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of all, and do leave the principalleſt
<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 23 1 Cor. 13 1 Tim. 1</note> or greateſt, which God requireth. The like did alſo many heretofore that were learned in the Law, upon whom the Lord pronounced wo, becauſe they obſerved the leaſt things of the Law (whileſt they tythed Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin) and left the greateſt matters of the Law,

               <p n="15">15. For albeit they obſerved all this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an outward ſhow, ſo as they ſeemed thereby to be righteous, yet was it all ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of no value, ſeeing they were not joyned with whole heart unto God,

               <p n="16">16. Furthermore, divers men there are found, which (after the outward faſhion) give every one his own, and unto divers (out of common love) ſhew outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169790:121"/>indifferently, who alſo carry themſelves ſo juſtly, that

               <p n="17">17. Therefore God is not appeaſed nor ſatisfied with the leaſt, when the heart is not turned from all viſible and mutable things, and doth not cleave perfectly unto him, or at leaſt endeavour towards it, to wit, that the man deſire of God out of his grace, that God will ſtrengthen him to the obeying of his will, and

               <p n="35">35.

               <p n="6">6. But whilſt now that in times paſt, there came a

               <p n="7">7. Now inaſmuch as divers in times paſt,
<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 15, 23. Joh. 9</note> gave greater reſpect to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But the believers (that gave more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the life of godlineſſe, then to the ceremonies or works of the Law) abode ſtill

               <p n="9">9. Therefore was the upright life at that time

               <p n="22">22. Foraſmuch then as the ſervices and ceremonies of the vain minded people (which are miniſtred in their eſtranging from Gods true righteouſneſſe) cannot bewitch our hearts, whileſt that we are not, nor may not be made partakers of their vain, perverſe and corrupt life with the heart, neither do ſuffer our ſelves to take pleaſure in ſuch things,

               <p n="25">25. Nevertheleſſe it is unto me wel known, that ſundry ſpeeches go about among the children of men, wherewith they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and blaſpheme our godly teſtimonies, and according to their conceit out of the Scripture or Letter, or out of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their knowledge, do alledge much there-againſt, ſaying, this is Gods commandement, hereby muſt we abide, or this is Gods forbidding, who can ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it?</p>
               <p n="26">26. It is true concerning the outwad, they can (out of the Scripture) ſpeak very much, do make therewith much

               <p n="28">28. But look into the matter ye dearly beloved, whether it goeth not now alſo as it did heretofore with the Galathians (when many of them were bound with the outward circumciſion)
<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3, 5, 6</note> whileſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cauſed themſelves to be circumciſed, ſuppoſing out of the teſtimonies of the Scripture according to the letter, that the ſame (although notwithſtanding it was not adminiſtred unto them out of the Word of life, under the obedience of the belief) was yet a commandement of the Lord, ſuch as according to the letter men were neceſſarily to keep; but inaſmuch as they diſtinguiſhed not the ſervices and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which were adminiſtred unto them out of the Word of Life, from the ſervices which were adminiſtred unto them out of the letter, without the word and light of Life, neither had the ſight of the living commandement of the Lord, or of God,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:169790:133"/>nor yet diſcerned or knew the ſame from the commandement according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, therefore were they

               <p n="29">29. On the other ſide, there were alſo many among the Corinthians, that

But what (I pray you) is there on the one ſide or on the other, or in any ſuch like that concerns us?</p>
               <p n="30">30. Verily in caſe we be come to the knowledge of the truth, and to the right diſcerning of this difference, then we know that all the outward ſervices of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then (ſo that the heart ſtand free from them) are not of force to

                  <p n="45">45. But becauſe this is not underſtood

                  <p n="46">46.

               <p n="17">17. But, O Beloved! tell me, I pray you, How will ye confeſſe Chriſt,

               <p n="18">18. True it is, ye have read or heard of Him in the Scripture; nevertheleſſe, many have never ſeen
<note n="r" place="margin">Joh. 5.</note> his ſhape, and his love dwelleth not in them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they underſtand not what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. For how ſhould you by any means confeſſe Chriſt, before

               <p n="20">20. Ruminate upon the ſenſe, mark well the ground, underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and take a view of your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee have received of Chriſt ſuch a cleerneſſe or not; and whether he be one with you, and ye with him, and with the Eather.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Now, if it be thus with you, to wit, that ye be come to ſuch a
<note n="x" place="margin">1 Theſ. 4 2 Theſſ. 2 1 Pet. 1.</note> ſanctification in the Spirit, through Chriſt, then ye know who he is for to confeſſe him; and yee know him, how that he is

<note n="z" place="margin">Apoc. 1.22.</note> who hath neither begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor ending.</p>
               <p n="22">22. He ſaith alſo,

                  <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh to the Father, but only through Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Moreover,

               </p>
               <p n="24">24. Therefore have regard to the ground of the Scriptures, how (in all things) they point us unto Chriſt, to the intent that he ſhould have his

<note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 17. Heb. 3. 2 Pet. 1.</note> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Being, if it were but right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood. For it is unpoſſible
<note n="e" place="margin">Exo. 33. Rom. 8. 1 Cor. 2.</note> to know the Spirit of Chriſt, with an heart that is cloathed or covered with a mind of the Fleſh.</p>
               <p n="25">25. If Chriſt therefore hath a Shape in you,

<note n="g" place="margin">Joh. 1. Acts 2. 2 Cor. 12 Gal. 1. 2 Pet. 1.</note> his Apoſtles confeſſed him by; even as it is written,</p>
               <p n="26">26. That which was

               <p n="27">27. Here may every one look into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether he alſo do thus know Chriſt, before he teſtifie or confeſſe much of him: otherwiſe he knoweth not what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Therefore, we muſt firſt be turned unto Chriſt according to the Truth; that is,
<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 5. Gal. 5. 1 Pet. 1.</note> in Hope, through Faith, unto the righteouſneſſe, and ſo, with good will, ſtand firm thereunto in the beleef,
<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 10. &amp; 16. Lu. 9.14.</note> take up daily our croſſe in the obedience of the holy Word of the Spirit of the love of Chriſt, and follow him with patience in our ſouls, to the ſalvation, untill he obtain a

<note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> of the croſſe becom a joy unto us; and ſo in the truth know him, to the intent we might confeſſe him rightly.</p>
               <p n="29">29. For the heart muſt be turned into him, and he into our hearts; and then may wee rightly confeſſe him with the mouth. Or thinkeſt thou, O thou man, that this pleaſeth God, to ſpeak of God ſometimes
<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> with the mouth, and ſo to

               <p n="30">30. For, if thine heart be not turned to Chriſt and his Service of love, neither be inclined to the

               <p>THere goeth alſo a common Saying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad amongſt many, and it is Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, [the which is recited in the firſt Book of the <hi>Glaſſe of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and alſo in many mo places of our Writings]

               <p n="2">2. Now, whiles ſome that have heard and ſpoken of this Sentence, underſtood not the Scripture, nor rightly took heed to the ſenſe of the Word, therefore they have not explained the meaning of the Word aright.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Truly, thoſe that cleave to the Word,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:169790:145"/>and his Service of Love in ſuch a ſort, and do ſo take and underſtand it, they have conceived altogether amiſſe of the Word and his requiring; and therefore they are

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This they ſay well; and run yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe forth, as if there were no God, nor Miniſtring of his Word, that loved or required the Righteouſneſſe; and do not once know, nor conſider the eſtranging or
<note n="e" place="margin">Iſa. 1.59.</note> falling from their God, whereby to turn them again to him and his Righteouſneſs, and to ſhew repentance or

               <p n="6">6. O God! How dangerous a time is it now

               <p n="7">7. What a number of falſe and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous windes do there blow among the children of men, to the hurt of their ſouls, and to a drawing of them away from the Righteouſneſſe!</p>

               <p n="9">9. Therefore it is expedient to have a regard to Underſtanding,

               <p n="54">54. For in their own eyes, they are the moſt underſtandingeſt, and the moſt beſt or

               <p>NOw ſome might here demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chriſtian Ceremonies be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all furtherſome, or whether they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169790:170"/>(omitting all other ceremonies) have not in them ſome advantage towards the life?

<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</note> the which is with the Chriſtian Services and Ceremonies, promiſed for to come unto them, to an everlaſting light and beholding of the naked clearneſſe of God, through the uncovered face of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</note> perſwade themſelves that they are the Chriſtians, or the people of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and do diligently uſe all dexterity &amp; ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wit in their cauſe, for to maintaine the ſame in his proceeding, and think by their wit to obtain the ſalvation, and ſo walk their own way;

               <p n="10">10. But inaſmuch as this godly Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is now out of grace revealed unto us, as that we through the clearneſſe which God hath powred into our hearts,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.</note> do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to what ſalvation, or to what maner of health of the earth <hi>God</hi> hath given his promiſes (to which purpoſefor to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169790:172"/>the ſalvation, the Beliefe is preached) Therefore for the loves ſake can we not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, but muſt needs witneſſe the ſame, and reveale the Peace, and the true Love whereunto we are called, if happily there might or may be found any which had a deſire or inclination thereunto: and then likewiſe we with them and they with us (whether they were far or neere) might be gathered together in the Love, according to the promiſes.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Seeing then that God neglecteth not his mercy towards is, but hath made known unto us his will (to the intent his Word may ſtand firm, according as he in times paſt hath ſpoken by his Prophets) that unto his people Iſrael he will gather him a people out of the Heathen, which ſhall ſerve him in righteouſneſſe:
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2 <hi>Amos</hi> 9 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2 <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</note> (at which time God will gather his people together again, and be gracious unto them, and build again the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> and again ſet up his people Iſrael, according to the promiſes:) therefore ought we in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the whole heart, and with good will to give heed unto that which is now by Gods grace, according to the truth, made known and tendered, under the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Love unto us: &amp; in the ſame

               <p n="12">12. But if any people refuſe it, and for all that ſhould perſwade themſelves in their hearts to be ſtill Chriſtians, or that their Congregation is the very people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (not thinking of the reſtoring of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> which in times paſt was fallen: and thus ſuppoſe that they have attained to the beſt) and in their blindneſſe ſet their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon their own wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ceremonies, and upon their faith; then ſhal it likewiſe goe with them in theſe dayes, as it did heretofore with the Jewes that beleeved not on the grace which was appeared unto them.</p>

               <p n="16">16 And through the revealing of ſuch a heavenly clearneſſe (as that we diſcern, that many, yea almoſt all, which doe boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Chriſtians, are yet meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers therefrom) we doe well know the fall from the right ground of the Chriſtianity, and the bands of darkneſſe wherewith we were all held captive: And therefore we are all void of the grace of God,
